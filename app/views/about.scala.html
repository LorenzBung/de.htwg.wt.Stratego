    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <div id="rules">
        <ul>
            <li>The game consists of a Board with a layout of 10x10.</li>
            <li>The fields 3, 4, 7 and 8 in lines 5 and 6 are blocked, so no figure can stand on them.</li>
            <li>Every player has a certain amount of figures with different strengths. Every player has:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 Flag: The goal of the game is to capture the enemy flag. The flag is immovable.</li>
                    <li>6 Bombs: The bombs kill every figure, except the Miners (strength 3). They are immovable.</li>
                    <li>1 Marshal (strength 10)</li>
                    <li>1 General (stength 9)</li>
                    <li>2 Colonels (strength 8)</li>
                    <li>3 Majors (strength 7)</li>
                    <li>4 Captains (strength 6)</li>
                    <li>4 Lieutenants (strength 5)</li>
                    <li>5 Sergeants (strength 4)</li>
                    <li>5 Miners (strength 3)</li>
                    <li>6 Scouts (strength 2)</li>
                    <li>1 Spy (strength 1)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In the beginning, the players place their figures in their own half (lines 1-4 / 7-10).</li>
            <li>Every figure (with exception to the Flag and Bombs) can be moved.
                The Scout (strength 2) can move in one direction as far as he likes, every other figure can only move one field.
                Diagonal movement and "jumping" figures is not possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                When moving onto the field of an enemy figure, the figure is attacked.
                Beating logic is simple: When a figure attacks a stronger figure, it dies.
                If the attacked figure is weaker or of the same strength, the attacker wins.
                The Flag can be defeated by every figure, Bombs always win (with exception to Miners).
                The Miners can also disarm a Bomb when attacking.
                The Spy (strength 1) can defeat the Marshal (strength 10) when attacking him.
                However, when the Marshal attacks the Spy, he wins.
            </li>
            <li>The game ends when one of the flags is captured by an enemy figure.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <div id="history">
        <p>In nearly its present form <em>Stratego</em> appeared in France from La Samaritaine in 1910, and then in Britain before World War I, as a game called <em>L'attaque</em>. Historian and game collector Thierry Depaulis writes:
            <blockquote>It was in fact designed by a lady, Mademoiselle Hermance Edan, who filed a patent for a <em>"jeu de bataille avec pièces mobiles sur damier"</em> (a battle game with mobile pieces on a gameboard) on 1908-11-26. The patent was released by the French Patent Office in 1909 (patent #396.795). Hermance Edan had given no name to her game but a French manufacturer named Au Jeu Retrouvé was selling the game as <em>L'Attaque</em> as early as 1910.</blockquote>
